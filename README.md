# Restaurant Review

## Purpose

As part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program I've created a small restaurant review app using the MapBox API and mock restaurant data. This application demonstrates my knowledge of responsive design, accessibility and service workers. The main two components of this application are the restaurant filter page, that lets you filter through restaurants based on location, and the restaurant info page that includes restaurant details and reviews.

## How to run

- From the root director of this project run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
- You should see the application running on `http://localhost:8000/`
